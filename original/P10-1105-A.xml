        <text>We present a generative phylogenetic model for automatically inducing cognate group structure from unaligned word lists. Our model represents the process of transformation and transmission from ancestor word to daughter word, as well as the alignment between the</text>

        <text>of the observed languages. We also present a novel method for simplifying complex weighted automata created during inference to counteract the otherwise exponential growth of message sizes. On the task of identifying cognates in a dataset of Romance words, our model significantly outperforms a baseline approach, increasing accuracy by as much as 80%. Finally, we demonstrate that our automatically induced groups can be used to successfully reconstruct ancestral words.</text>

        <text>method requires reasoning about three important hidden variables: the overall phylogenetic guide tree among languages, the evolutionary parameters of the ambient changes at each branch, and the cognate group structure that specifies which words share common ancestors.</text>
        <text>\\ All three of these variables interact and inform each other, and so, historical linguists often consider them jointly. However, linguists are currently required to make qualitative judgments regarding the relative likelihood of certain sound changes, cognate groups, and so on. Several recent statistical methods have been introduced to provide increased quantitative backing to the comparative method (Oakes, 2000; Bouchard-Côté et al., 2007; Bouchard-Côté et al., 2009); others have modeled the spread of language changes and speciation (Ringe et al., 2002; Daumé III and Campbell, 2007; Daumé III, 2009; Nerbonne, 2010). These automated methods, while providing robustness and scale in the induction of ancestral word forms and evolutionary parameters, assume that cognate groups are already known. In this work, we address this limitation, presenting a model in which cognate groups can be discovered automatically.</text>
        <text>\\ Finding cognate groups is not an easy task, because underlying morphological and phonological changes can obscure relationships between words, especially for distant cognates, where simple string overlap is an inadequate measure of similarity. Indeed, a standard string similarity metric like</text>
        <edit type="grammar" crr="the" comments="grammar - needs an article here"></edit>
        <text>Levenshtein distance can lead to false positives. Consider the often cited example of Greek /ma:ti/ and Malay /mata/, both meaning “eye” (Bloomfield, 1938). If we were to rely on the Levenshtein distance, these words would seem to be a highly attractive match as cognates: they are nearly identical, essentially differing in only a single character. However, no linguist would posit that these two words are related. To correctly learn that they are not related, linguists typically rely on two kinds of evidence. First, because sound change is largely regular, we would need to commonly see /i/ in Greek wherever we see /a/ in Malay (Ross, 1950). Second, we should look at languages closely related to Greek and Malay, to see if similar patterns hold there, too.</text>
        <text>\\ Some authors have attempted to automatically detect cognate words (Mann and Yarowsky, 2001; Lowe and Mazaudon, 1994; Oakes, 2000; Kondrak, 2001; Mulloni, 2007), but these methods typically work on language pairs rather than on larger language families. To fully automate the comparative method, it is necessary to consider multiple languages</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - comma not needed here">,</edit>
        <text>and to do so in a model which couples cognate detection with similarity learning.</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, we present a new generative model for the automatic induction of cognate groups given only (1) a known family tree of languages and (2) word lists from those languages. A prior</text>

        <text>on word survival generates a number of cognate groups and decides which groups are attested in each modern language. An evolutionary model captures how each word is generated from its parent word. Finally, an alignment model maps the flat word lists to cognate groups. Inference requires a combination of message-passing in the evolutionary model and iterative bipartite graph matching in the alignment model.</text>
        <text>\\ In the message-passing phase, our model encodes distributions over strings as weighted finite state automata (Mohri, 2009). Weighted automata have been successfully applied to speech processing (Mohri et al., 1996) and more recently to morphology (Dreyer and Eisner, 2009). Here, we present a new method for automatically compressing our message automata in a way that can take into account prior information about the expected outcome of inference.</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, we focus on a transcribed word list of 583 cognate sets from three Romance languages (Portuguese, Italian, and Spanish), as well as their common ancestor Latin (Bouchard-Côté et al., 2007). We consider both the case where we know that all cognate groups have a surface form in all languages, and where we do not know that. On the former, easier task, we achieve identification accuracies of 90.6%. On the latter task, we achieve F1 scores of 73.6%. Both substantially beat baseline performance.</text>
