        <text>the computational perspectives. Non-projective structures are assumed to be both more complex to analyze as well as more difficult to parse. Figure 1 shows a Hindi sentence involving a non projective dependency between abhay kaa 'Abhay's' and caSamaa 'spectacles'.</text>
        <text>\\ Formally, an arc i â†’ j is projective if and only if there is no word k between i and j that i does not dominate (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).</text>
        <text>\\ While some parsing paradigms can handle such dependencies, others either cannot or have special mechanisms to process them (e.g., Kuhlmann and Nivre (2010); Rambow and Joshi (1994)). Many theoretical approaches have special mechanisms to account for these constructions within their framework (e.g., Chomsky (1981); Pollard and Sag (1994)).</text>
        <text>\\ It is unclear if the complexity arising from non-projectivity has any processing cost in human language comprehension. That is, does the human sentence processing system find such sentences difficult to process, compared to projective dependencies? Previous work has addressed this question. In a classic study, Bach et al. (1986) showed that Dutch speakers find cross-serial dependencies in Dutch more acceptable compared to German speakers who read</text>

        <text>matched set of embedded constructions in German. Other work has looked at filler-gap dependencies, but these have generally focused on the question of wh movement (e.g., Traxler and Pickering (1996)). More recently, Levy et al. (2012) have directly taken up the issue of non projectivity and sentence processing. They raised the following questions:</text>
        <text>\ Under what circumstances are</text>
        <edit type="hyphenation" crr="non projective-dependenc" comments="hyphenation - missing here.">non projective dependenc</edit>
        <text>structures easier or harder to comprehend than corresponding projective-dependency structures?</text>
        <text>How can these differences in comprehension difficulty be understood with respect to existing theories of online comprehension?</text>
        <text>Levy et al. (2012) try to answer the above questions using right-extraposed relative clauses in English. They show that the right-extraposed version is more costly than the embedded relative clause (RC), hence demonstrating that non projective structures are indeed costlier than the projective counterpart. Additionally, they argue that the expectation-based theory of surprisal (Levy, 2008) explains the experimental results better than other competing theories like the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) and the derivational theory of complexity (Miller, 1962).</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, we take up Levy's questions by investigating non-projectivity in Hindi participle clauses. We confirm that non projectivity is indeed costly. However, we show that surprisal is unable to account for the increased processing cost</text>

        <text>and that the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) can partly account for the results. To anticipate the conclusion, we argue that while expectation (formalized as</text>

        <text>conditional probability of the head in a dependency given previous syntactic dependencies) is relevant for explaining processing of non projective dependencies, other factors (that can be orthogonal to predictive processing) can be equally critical.
