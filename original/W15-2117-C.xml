    <abstract>
        <text>Non-projectivity is an important theoretical and computational concept that has been investigated extensively in the dependency grammar/parsing paradigms. However, from a human</text>
        <edit type="hyphenation" crr="sentence-processing" comments="">sentence processing</edit>
        <text>perspective, non-projectivity has received very little attention. In this paper, we</text>

        <text>existing work and propose new factors related to processing non-projective configuration. We argue that (a) counter to the claims in the psycholinguistic literature (Levy et al, 2012), different aspects of prediction maintenance can lead to higher processing cost for a non-projective dependency, (b) parsing strategies can interact with the expectation for a non-projective dependency, and (c) memory (re)activation can explain processing cost in certain non-projective configurations.</text>

        <text>computational perspectives. Non-projective structures are assumed to be both more complex to analyze and more difficult to parse. Figure 1 shows a Hindi sentence involving a non-projective dependency between abhay kaa 'Abhay's' and caSamaa 'spectacles'.</text>
        <text>\\ Formally, an arc i â†’ j is projective if and only if there is no word k between i and j that i does not dominate (Nivre and Nilsson, 2005).</text>
        <text>\\ While some parsing paradigms can handle such dependencies, others either cannot or have special mechanisms to process them (e.g., Kuhlmann and Nivre (2010); Rambow and Joshi (1994)). Many theoretical approaches have special mechanisms to account for these constructions within their framework (e.g., Chomsky (1981); Pollard and Sag (1994)).</text>

        <text>the following questions:</text>
        <text>\ Under what circumstances are non-projective dependency structures easier or harder to comprehend than corresponding projective-dependency structures?</text>
        <text>\ How can these differences in comprehension difficulty be understood with respect to existing theories of online comprehension?</text>

        <text>the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) and the derivational theory of complexity (Miller, 1962).</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, we take up Levy's questions by investigating non-projectivity in Hindi participle clauses. We confirm that non-projectivity is indeed costly. However, we show that surprisal is unable to account for the increased processing cost, and that the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) can partly account for the results. To anticipate the conclusion, we argue that while expectation (formalized as conditional probability of the head in a dependency given previous syntactic dependencies) is relevant for explaining processing of non-projective dependencies, other factors (that can be orthogonal to predictive processing) can be equally critical. In particular, the following factors are implicated in the processing of non-projective dependencies: (a) The nature of the intervening material between a head and its dependent; (b) The nature of the head-dependent relation; (c) The length/complexity of the intervening material; (d) memory activation; and (e) parsing strategies.</text>
        <text>\\ Hindi is a useful language for investigating non-projectivity, because its relatively free-word order allows non-projective dependencies to occur quite frequently (see Mannem et al. (2009) for a more detailed discussion).</text>
