        <text>Quotations, Relevance and Time Depth: Medieval Arabic Literature in Grids and Networks</text>

        <text>This contribution deals with the use of quotations (i.e., repeated n-grams) in the works of medieval Arabic literature. The analysis is based on a</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>The relevance of individual works in a given literature and the time depth of such relevance are of interest for many reasons. There are</text>

        <text>\\ Our understanding of quotations in this project is limited to similar strings of words, i.e., the quotations are very close to borrowings or repetitions of verbatim or almost verbatim passages. Technically,</text>

        <text>\\ In a different context and without direct inspiration, we developed an algorithm that is tolerant to a certain degree of lexical and morphological variation and word order variability.</text>

        <text>This does not necessarily mean that the lineage of quotations is complete in our picture, for we have to admit that there could be some author —</text>
        <edit type="clarity" crr="a" comments="added for clarity"></edit>
        <text>member of the lineage — who is not involved in our corpus. In our graph, however, edges point to the first instance of a given n-gram in our data.</text>
