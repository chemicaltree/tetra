        <text>\\ A crucial prerequisite for building a treebank is to have a set of annotation guidelines which describe how particular syntactic structures are to be represented. In our work on creating a treebank for Bambara, we have chosen version 2.0 of the Universal Dependencies scheme (Nivre et al., 2016) as it provides ready-made recommendations on which to base annotation guidelines for part-of-speech tags, morphological features, and dependency relations. This reduces the amount of time needed</text>

        <text>where the existing universal guidelines are adequate they can be imported wholesale into the language-specific guidelines. In addition, the Universal Dependencies project provides a free/open pool (in the terminology of Streiter et al. (2006)) which collects dependency corpora in a single place</text>
