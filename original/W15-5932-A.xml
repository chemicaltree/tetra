        <text>based on online customer reviews is an area that has not received much attention. This paper presents Ruchi, a system capable of rating individual food items in restaurants. Ruchi makes use of Named Entity Recognition (NER) techniques to identify food names in restaurant reviews.</text>

        <text>is used to identify opinions associated with different food names in a single sentence, thus it is possible to carry out entity-level sentiment analysis to rate individual food items instead of sentence-level sentiment analysis as done by previous research.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>Today, many factors affect a person's selection of a particular restaurant to dine in. People can find information on factors such as price,</text>

        <text>and service from a restaurant's website and/or brochures. However, information about some important factors is not directly available</text>

        <text>Therefore, it is common nowadays for people to rely on the reviews and ratings</text>

        <text>sites is time consuming, boring, and exhaustive. This becomes more complex if someone wishes to search for a particular food item that</text>
        <edit type="style" crr="they are" comments="style - using singular they for gender neutrality">he</edit>
        <text>interested in.</text>
        <text>\\ Existing restaurant recommendation systems such as Yelp do not have the facility to rate the individual food items of a restaurant. Moreover, as far as we are aware, existing research on restaurant recommendation systems has not focused on rating</text>
        <edit type="readability" crr="restaurants' individual food items" comments="readability - this is less awkward">individual food items of restaurants</edit>
        <text>, except for the work of Trevisiol et al. (2014).</text>
        <text>\\ This paper presents Ruchi (Ruchi means taste in Sinhala and Tamil, the two local languages in Sri Lanka), which is a system for rating individual food items (both food and beverages) in restaurants by automatically analyzing customer reviews. It combines the techniques of machine learning, natural language processing and information retrieval.</text>
        <text>\\ In order to rate and recommend individual food items, it is necessary to identify food names in customer reviews, and the customer opinions associated with them. Food names in reviews are identified using a trained NER model. For this purpose, a corpus created from online customer reviews for restaurants is automatically annotated with food names extracted from various sources. As far as we are aware, this is the only freely available comprehensive corpus annotated with food names. Opinions related to these identified food items are extracted using a typed dependency parser. We then perform entity-level sentiment analysis to find the polarity of these opinions. Finally, individual food items are rated based on the polarities of all the opinions received for each of these food items.</text>
        <text>\\ The rest of the paper is organized as follows.</text>

        <text>section discusses related work. Section three gives an overview of sentiment analysis. Section four discusses the data collection process. Section five discusses research and development work. Section six contains evaluation and discussion, and finally, section seven concludes the paper.</text>
