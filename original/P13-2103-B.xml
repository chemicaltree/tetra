    <introduction>
        <text>Stanford Dependencies (SD) provide a functional characterization of the grammatical relations in syntactic trees, capturing the predicate-argument structure of natural language sentences (de Marneffe et al., 2006). The SD representation</text>

        <text>useful in a range of downstream tasks, including Textual Entailments (Dagan et al., 2006) and BioNLP (Fundel and Zimmer., 2007), and in recent years, SD structures have also become a de facto standard for parser evaluation in English (de Marneffe and Manning, 2008a; Cer et al., 2010; Nivre et al., 2010). Efforts</text>

        <text>SD for cross-lingual annotation and evaluation (McDonald et al., 2013; Che et al., 2012; Haverinen et al., 2011). By and large, these efforts aim to remain as close as possible to the original SD scheme. However, the original SD design emphasizes word tokens and configurational structures, and</text>

        <text>, these schemes overlook properties and realization patterns observed in a range of languages known as Morphologically Rich Languages (MRLs) (Tsarfaty et al., 2010).</text>
        <text>\\ MRLs use word-level affixes to express grammatical relations that are typically indicated by structural positions in English. By virtue of word-level morphological marking, word order in MRLs may be flexible. MRLs have been a focal point</text>

        <text>the parsing community due to the challenges that these phenomena pose for systems originally developed for English. Here we argue that the SD hierarchy and design principles similarly emphasize English-like structures and underrepresent morphosyntactic argument-marking alternatives. We define an extension of SD, called Unified-SD (U-SD), which unifies the annotation of structurally and morphologically marked relations via an inheritance hierarchy. We extend SD with a functional branch, and provide a principled treatment of morpho-syntactic argument marking.</text>
        <text>\\ Based on the U-SD scheme, we create a new parallel resource for the MRL Modern Hebrew, whereby aligned constituency and dependency trees reflect equivalent U-SD annotations</text>
