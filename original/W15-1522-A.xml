        <text>Distributed Word Representations Improve NER for e-Commerce</text>

    <abstract>
        <text>This paper presents a case study of using distributed word representations, word2vec in particular, for improving performance of Named Entity Recognition for the</text>

        <text>domain. We also demonstrate that distributed word representations trained on a smaller amount of in-domain data are more effective than word vectors trained on very large amount of out-of-domain data, and that their combination gives the best results.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>On-line commerce has gained a lot of popularity over the past decade. Large on-line</text>
        <edit type="clarity" crr="customer-to-customer (C2C)" comments="clarity - expanding acronym">C2C</edit>
        <text>marketplaces like eBay, Alibaba, and Amazon feature a very large and long-tail inventory with millions of items (product offers) entered into the marketplace every day by a large variety of sellers.</text>
        <text>\\ To manage items effectively and provide the best user experience, it is critical for these marketplaces to structure their inventory into descriptive name-value pairs (called properties) and ensure that items of the same kind (digital cameras, for instance) are described using a unique set of properties (brand name, model number, zoom, resolution, etc.). This is important for</text>

        <text>, providing faceted navigation, and assisting business intelligence applications.</text>
        <text>\\ While some sellers (generally large, professional retailers) provide rich, structured descriptions of their products (using schemas or global trade item numbers), the vast majority of sellers only provide unstructured natural language descriptions. In the latter case, one solution to the problem of structuring e-commerce inventory is to use techniques such as</text>

        <text>to extract properties from the textual description of the items. The scale at which on-line marketplaces operate makes it impractical to solve this problem manually.</text>
        <text>This paper focuses on NER, generally defined as the task of classifying elements of text into predefined categories (often referred to as entity types or entities). Entities usually include</text>

        <text>, organizations, locations, times, and quantities (CoNLL-2003 dataset), as well as nationalities or religious groups, products (vehicles, weapons, foods, etc.), and titles of books or songs (Ontonotes 5.0 dataset).</text>
        <text>\\ In the e-commerce domain, these entities are item properties such as brand name, color, material, clothing size, golf club type, makeup shade code, sun protection factor, etc. Another important</text>

        <text>of the e-commerce domain with respect to NER is that the sentences are usually much shorter than in other applications and don't exhibit the grammatical structure of natural language.</text>

        <text>\\ In the remainder of this paper, we first explain the specificity of NER in the e-commerce domain and describe the approach we use for performing the task. In Section 3, we describe our datasets. In Section 4, we describe the setting of the experiments we have conducted</text>
