        <text>This led us to look more closely at the structure of the treebank grammar. The resulting analysis builds on the presentation of Charniak (1996), but extends it by elucidating the structure of nonterminal interrelationships in the Penn Treebank grammar. On the basis of these studies, we build simple theoretical models which closely predict observed parser performance, and, in particular, explain the originally observed supercubic behavior.</text>

        <text>, coverage was never an issue. Every sentence parsed had at least one parseâ€” the parse with which it was originally observed.</text>
        <text>The sentences were parsed using an implementation of the probabilistic chart-parsing algorithm presented in (Klein and Manning, 2001).
