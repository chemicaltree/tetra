    <introduction>
        <text>Mild cognitive impairment (MCI) is a heterogeneous set of symptoms that are essential in the early detection of Alzheimer's Disease (AD) (Negash et al., 2007). Symptoms such as language dysfunctions may occur</text>

        <text>results on identifying different types of dementia with NLP and speech recognition techniques. For instance, automatic speech recognition tools were employed in detecting aphasia (Fraser et al., 2013b; Fraser et al., 2014; Fraser et al., 2013a), and mild cognitive impairment (Lehr et al., 2012), and Alzheimer's Disease (Baldas et al., 2010; Satt et al., 2014). Jarrold et al. (2014) distinguished four types of dementia on the basis of spontaneous speech samples. Lexical analysis of spontaneous speech may also indicate different types of dementia (Bucks et al., 2000; Holmes and Singh, 1996) and may be</text>
