        <text>Simple and Effective Text Simplification Using Semantic and Neural Methods</text>

    <abstract>
        <text>Sentence splitting is a major simplification operator. Here we present a simple and efficient splitting algorithm based on an automatic semantic parser. After splitting, the text is amenable</text>

Splitting based on semantic parsing, as proposed here, alleviates this issue.

        <text>\n\n TS includes both structural and lexical operations. The main structural simplification operation is sentence splitting, namely rewriting a single sentence into multiple sentences while preserving its meaning. While recent improvement in TS has been achieved by the use of neural</text>

        <text>(NMT) approaches (Nisioi et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2017; Zhang and Lapata, 2017), where TS is considered a case of monolingual translation, the sentence splitting operation has not been addressed by these systems, potentially due to</text>

        <text>in the training corpora (Narayan and Gardent, 2014; Xu et al., 2015).</text>
        <text>\n\n We show that the explicit integration of sentence splitting in the simplification system could also reduce conservatism, which is a grave limitation of NMT-based TS systems (Alva-Manchego et al., 2017). Indeed, experimenting with a state-of-the-art neural system (Nisioi et al., 2017), we find that 66% of the input sentences remain unchanged, while none of the corresponding references</text>

        <text>The first involves handcrafted syntactic rules, whose compilation and validation are laborious (Shardlow, 2014). For example, Siddharthan and Angrosh (2014) used 111 rules for relative clauses, appositions, subordination</text>

        <text>, are usually language specific, requiring the development of new rules when ported to other languages (Alu´ısio and Gasperin, 2010; Seretan, 2012; Hung et al., 2012; Barlacchi and Tonelli, 2013, for Portuguese, French, Vietnamese, and Italian respectively). The second method uses linguistic information for detecting potential splitting points, while splitting probabilities are learned using a parallel corpus. For example, in the system of Narayan and Gardent (2014) (henceforth, HYBRID), the state-of-the-art for joint structural and lexical TS, potential splitting points are determined by event boundaries.</text>

        <text>\n\n We use the UCCA scheme for semantic representation (Abend and Rappoport, 2013), where the semantic units are anchored in the text, which simplifies the splitting operation. We further leverage the explicit distinction in UCCA between types of Scenes (events), applying a specific rule for each of the cases. Nevertheless, the DSS approach can be adapted to other semantic schemes, like AMR (Banarescu et al., 2013)</text>
