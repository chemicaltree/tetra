        <text>Generating Varied Narrative Probability Exercises</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>This paper presents Genpex, a system for automatic generation of narrative probability exercises. Generation of exercises in Genpex is done in two steps. First, the system creates a specification of a solvable probability problem</text>

        <text>parameters. By varying the mathematical content of the exercise, its narrative context, and the linguistic parameter settings, many different exercises can be produced. Here, we focus on the natural language generation part of Genpex. After describing how the system works, we briefly present our first evaluation results, and discuss some aspects requiring further investigation.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>Narrative exercises (also called word problems or story problems) are mathematical exercises embedded in a story or text. They are commonly used as test items</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - comma not needed before prepositional phrase">,</edit>
        <text>to assess or train a student's understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts. When solving a narrative exercise, the student is required to derive the underlying mathematical question from the story and to calculate the correct answer to this mathematical problem.</text>
        <text>\\ This paper presents Genpex, a system for generating narrative exercises expressing probability problems. Genpex was created in the context of an international project on item generation for testing student competencies in solving probability problems. Automatic item generation is an effective way of constructing many items with controlled difficulties, based on a set of predefined task parameters (Enright et al., 2002; Deane and Sheehan, 2003; Arendasy et al., 2006; Holling et al., 2009). The goal of our</text>
        <edit type="hyphenation" crr="item-generation" comments="hyphenation - compound adjective">item generation</edit>
        <text>project is to develop a model to support optimal problem and test construction. A large collection of narrative exercises is needed to test the developed models in field trials. All of these narrative exercises should be different, but the properties that define the difficulty of the exercise should be known. Genpex was designed to enable easy creation of new exercises meeting these requirements.</text>
        <text>\\ Figure 1 shows a narrative probability exercise generated by Genpex. The text of the exercise is in German, because the target group of our project are German high school students. The texts produced by Genpex are based on a set of example narrative exercises that were created earlier within the project (Zeuch, In preparation).</text>
        <text>\\ A property that sets Genpex apart from other narrative exercise generation systems is that it was specifically designed to support variation in the generated exercises. Unlike other systems, it not only changes the context of the narrative exercise (e.g., instead of bikes, the example exercise could also have been about hotel rooms with different properties) but it also varies the way the texts are formulated. Most existing systems for narrative exercise generation use fixed sentence templates to express mathematical content, which means that the same content is always expressed in the same way (Fairon and Williamson, 2002; Arendasy et al., 2006; Holling et al., 2009). A system that uses a linguistically sophisticated approach, thus in principle allowing for similar text variations as Genpex, is ModelCreator (Deane and Sheehan, 2003; Higgins et al., 2005). However,</text>

        <text>focuses on semantic factors influencing the expression of events with different participants (e.g., different types of vehicles) rather than on generating linguistic variations.</text>
        <text>\\ Below, we first describe how a probability problem is constructed by Genpex based on input by the user. Then we explain in some detail how the natural language generation (NLG) module of Genpex creates a text expressing the probability problem, focusing on the creation of variation in the generated texts. We end with a brief discussion of our first evaluation results and some pointers to future work.</text>
