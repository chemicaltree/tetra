        <edit type="word choice" crr="that" comments="I think that works better than such here">such</edit>
        <text>distortion limit. Consider the sentence pair in the NIST MT2005 test set shown in figure 1(a): after translating the word “修补/mend”, the decoder should “jump” across six words and translate the last phrase “关系 裂缝/fissures in the relationship”. Therefore, while short-distance reordering is under the scope of the distance-based model, long-distance reordering is simply out of the question.</text>
        <text>\\ A terminological remark: In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="," comments="comma before closing adverb - this can be style specific"></edit>
        <text>respectively. The distinction between</text>
        <edit type="hyphenation;consistency" crr="long- and short-distance" comments="hyphenation/consistency - compound adjective needs hyphen . This is hyphenated elsewhere">long and short distance</edit>
        <text>reordering is solely defined by the distortion limit.</text>
        <text>\\ Syntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering. For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side. However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks. It should be noted that the second Chinese block “结束时” and its English counterpart “at the end of” are not constituents at all.</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, our interest is the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering and</text>

        <text>\\ Our method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches like (Xia and McCord, 2004), (Collins et al., 2005), and (Costa-jussa and Fonollosà, 2006), which split translation into two stages: [MATH] where a sentence of the source language (SL), S, is first reordered with respect to the word order of the target language (TL),</text>

        <text>a TL sentence, T, by monotonous translation.</text>
        <text>\\ Our first contribution is a new translation model as represented by formula 2: [MATH] where an n-best list of S', instead of only one S', is generated. The reason</text>

        <text>change will be given in section 2. Note also that the translation process S' → T is not monotonous, since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering. Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation: [MATH] where Fi are the features in the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S → S’) is our new feature, viz. the probability of reordering S as S'. The details of this model are elaborated in sections 3 to 6. The settings and results of experiments on this new model are given in section 7.</text>
