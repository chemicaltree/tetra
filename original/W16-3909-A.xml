        <text>Name Variation in Community Question Answering Systems</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>Community question answering systems are forums where users can ask and answer questions in various categories. Examples are Yahoo! Answers, Quora, and Stack Overflow. A common challenge with such systems is that a significant percentage of asked questions are left unanswered. In this paper, we propose an algorithm to reduce the number of unanswered questions in Yahoo! Answers by reusing the answer to</text>
        <edit type="readability;clarity" crr="the past resolved question from the site which is the most similar to the unanswered question." comments="readability / clarity - this is more readable and clear as it gets the comparison between the two items being compared and moves the 'from the site' phrase closer to what it modifies">the most similar past resolved question to the unanswered question, from the site.</edit>
        <text>Semantically similar questions could be worded differently, thereby making it difficult to find questions that have shared needs. For example, Who is the best player for the Reds? and Who is currently the biggest star at Manchester United? have a shared need but are worded differently; also, Reds and Manchester United are used to refer to the soccer team Manchester United</text>
        <edit type="capitalization" crr="Football Club" comments="capitalization - this is part of the proper name">football club</edit>
        <text>. In this research, we focus on question categories that contain a large number of named entities and entity name variations. We show that in these categories, entity linking can be used to identify relevant past resolved questions with shared needs as a given question by disambiguating named entities and matching these questions based on the disambiguated entities, identified entities, and knowledge base information related to these entities. We evaluated our algorithm on a new dataset constructed from Yahoo! Answers. The dataset contains annotated question pairs, (Qgiven, [Qpast, Answer]). We carried out experiments on several question categories and show that an entity-based approach gives good performance when searching for similar questions in entity-rich categories.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>In community question answering (CQA) systems, users prefer asking other users questions because (I) their questions are personal and require a direct answer from users with similar experiences or users familiar with the question, (II) no single web page can answer their question, and (III) users want to communicate and exchange ideas with other users. One of the challenges with such systems is that some questions are left unanswered because:</text>
        <text>\ they are short and lack relevant content</text>
        <text>\ they are not clearly expressed</text>
        <text>\ they are not appropriately assigned to a user that is able to answer the question</text>
        <text>Approximately 15% of incoming English questions in Yahoo! Answers do not receive any answer and leave the user that asked the question (asker) unsatisfied (Shtok et al., 2012). One approach to reducing the number of unanswered questions in a CQA is to direct an unanswered question to a user knowledgeable about the question (Dror et al., 2011). Another approach automatically extracts answers from a knowledge base (KB) such as Wikipedia, text passage, or the web (Gyongyi et al., 2007). In certain question categories in Yahoo! Answers, approximately 25% of questions are recurrent (Shtok et al., 2012). A third approach takes advantage of this question recurrence by reusing past resolved questions (PARQ) from within Yahoo! Answers to satisfy unanswered questions. Shtok et al. (2012) used this third approach to satisfy unanswered questions in the Beauty and Style, Health, and Pets question categories by matching new questions to PARQ's if they had a cosine similarity score above a threshold (0.9); features were then extracted from the new question and PARQâ€™s to train a classifier. Certain question categories such as Sports have a high occurrence of named entities and entity name variations. For example, a sports team can be referred to by its official name, the name of the city it plays in</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="," comments="punctuation - missing comma"></edit>
        <text>or by any of several nicknames. Also, the vocabulary in questions in these categories can be diverse and questions are often very short (Klang and Nugues, 2014; Khalid et al., 2008).</text>
        <text>\\ The contribution of this paper is to propose an alternative approach to reducing the number of unanswered questions in question categories that contain a large number of entities by taking advantage of the recent successes in entity linking. We now have systems that can disambiguate named entities</text>

        <text>a KB. Matching questions and answers based on these disambiguated entities, entities, and KB information related to these entities finds most of the relevant answers to a given question.</text>
        <text>\\ We investigate the validity of using an entity-based approach in entity-rich categories by first analyzing 150 questions from each of the following categories Beauty and Style, Health, Pets, Sports, Entertainment and Music, and Parenting.</text>
        <text>\\ Table 1 shows that more questions in the Sports and Entertainment and Music categories contain named entities and/or entity variations. We annotated 200 question pairs that each exhibit shared needs from the Sports and Entertainment and Music question categories. We observed that 82% of the relevant annotated question pairs contain either the same named entity or a variation of the entity. This percentage could increase on a larger dataset. We also observed that the cosine similarity score of the relevant question pairs varied</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr=";" comments="punctuation - need semicolon before the i.e. phrase when it precedes an independent clause"></edit>
        <text> i.e., the cosine similarity was high in some relevant question pairs and low in others. Hence, we propose to use an entity-based approach in question categories with high entity usage.</text>
