        <text>Non-projectivity and processing constraints: Insights from Hindi</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>Non-projectivity is an important theoretical and computational concept that has been investigated extensively in the dependency grammar/parsing paradigms. However, from a human sentence processing perspective, non-projectivity has received very little attention. In this paper, we look at existing work and propose new factors related to processing non-projective</text>

        <text>computational perspectives. Non-projective structures are assumed to be both more complex to analyze and more difficult to parse. Figure 1 shows a Hindi sentence involving a non-projective dependency between abhay kaa 'Abhay's' and caSamaa 'spectacles'.</text>

        <text>the issue of non-projectivity and sentence processing. They raised the following questions:</text>
        <text>\ Under what circumstances are non-projective dependency structures easier or harder to comprehend than corresponding projective-dependency structures?</text>
        <text>\ How can these differences in comprehension difficulty be understood with respect to existing theories of online comprehension?</text>
        <text>Levy et al. (2012) try to answer the above questions using right-extraposed relative clauses in English. They show that the right-extraposed version is more costly than the embedded relative clause (RC), </text>

        <edit type="clarity" crr="thier" comments="">the</edit>
        <text>projective counterparts. Additionally, they argue that the expectation-based theory of surprisal (Levy, 2008) explains the experimental results better than other competing theories, like the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) and the derivational theory of complexity (Miller, 1962).</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, we take up Levy's questions by investigating non-projectivity in Hindi participle clauses. We confirm that non-projectivity is indeed costly. However, we show that surprisal</text>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="does not" comments="">is unable to</edit>
        <text>account for the increased processing cost, and that the cue-based memory model of Lewis and Vasishth (2005) can partly account for the results. To anticipate the conclusion, we argue that, while expectation (formalized as conditional probability of the head in a dependency given previous syntactic dependencies) is relevant for explaining processing of non-projective dependencies, other factors (that can be orthogonal to predictive processing) can be equally critical. In particular, the following factors are implicated in the processing of non-projective dependencies: (a)</text>

        <text>of the intervening material between a head and its dependent; (b) the nature of the head-dependent relation; (c) the length/complexity of the intervening material; (d) memory activation; and (e) Parsing strategies.</text>
        <text>\\ Hindi is a useful language for investigating non-projectivity because its relatively free-word order allows non-projective dependencies to occur quite frequently (see Mannem et al. (2009) for a more detailed discussion).</text>
