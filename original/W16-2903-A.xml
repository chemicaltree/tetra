        <text>Identification, characterization, and grounding of gradable terms in clinical text</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>Gradable adjectives are inherently vague and are used by clinicians to document medical interpretations (e.g., severe reaction, mild symptoms). We present a comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in the clinical domain. We automatically identify gradable adjectives and demonstrate that they have a substantial presence in clinical text. Further, we show that there is a specific pattern associated with their usage, where certain medical concepts are more likely to be described using these adjectives than others. Interpretation of statements using such adjectives is a barrier in medical decision making. Therefore, we use a simple probabilistic model to ground their meaning based on their usage in context.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>Expressions used in a language are said to be vague if they do not convey a precise meaning. Sentences using vague expressions do not give rise to precise truth conditions (Kennedy, 2007). Consider the following sentence: “The patient was maintained on a high dose of insulin.” Interpreting such statements is a problem since</text>
        <edit type="readability" crr="the exact amount of insulin that was used is unclear." comments="readability - reworded this sentence to be less awkward">it is unclear what was the exact amount of insulin that was used.</edit>
        <edit type="spelling" crr="Gradeability" comments="spelling - gradable but gradeability">Gradability</edit>
        <text>(Sapir, 1944; Lyons, 1977) is a semantic property that allows a word to describe the intensity of a measure in context</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - no comma needed before conjunction because what follows is not a full sentence">,</edit>
        <text>and thus enables comparative constructs. In the above example, the word</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="“high”" comments="punctuation - I would put this in quotes or italics to call out what we're using the word as a noun.">high</edit>
        <text>is said to be gradable since it conveys the meaning associated with the measure</text>
        <edit type="clarity;punctuation" crr=": the amount." comments="clarity and punctuation - I think this is the author's intention - to use 'the amount' as a specifier for the measure.">- amount.</edit>
        <text>\n\n Gradable adjectives inherently possess a degree of vagueness and are used in a language to express epistemic uncertainties (Kennedy, 2007; Frazier et al., 2008). While judgments are strong in extreme cases, there exist borderline cases</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - comma is not appropriate here">,</edit>
        <text>where it is difficult to ascribe an adjective. In the above example, some amounts of insulin would be considered as a high dose by all, other amounts would never be considered a high dose, but there is a middle range where it can be difficult for even experts to judge</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - comma is not appropriate here">,</edit>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="whether" comments="word choice - 'whether' fits better here, with the 'or not' implied.">if</edit>
        <text>it is a high dose. This is because</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="" comments="punctuation - comma is not appropriate here">,</edit>
        <text>different experts may have differing thresholds for what constitutes a high dose.</text>
        <text>\n\n Broadly, gradable adjectives can be classified into two categories based on their interpretation as measure functions (Bartsch, 1975; Kennedy, 1999). Adjectives such as</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="“tall,“heavy,” and “expensive”" comments="punctuation - as above, setting off this word to show it's used as a noun">tall,heavy, expensive</edit>
        <text>can be viewed as measurements that are clearly associated with a numerical quantity (height, weight, cost). In contrast, adjectives like</text>
        <edit type="punctuation" crr="“clever,” “beautiful,” and “naive”" comments="punctuation - as above, setting off this word to show it's used as a noun">clever, beautiful, naive</edit>
        <text>are more complex and underspecified for the exact feature being measured. Gradable adjectives have been the focus of several recent studies (de Melo and Bansal, 2013; Ruppenhofer et al., 2014) in the NLP community. Gradablity is property</text>
        <edit type="readability" crr="that is" comments="readability - not strictly needed but helps with the flow"></edit>
        <text>not limited to adjectives </text>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="but" comments="word choice - 'but' is the appropriate conjunction since we're setting up a contrast">and</edit>    
        <text>also extends to other parts of speech such as adverbs (Shivade et al., 2015; Ruppenhofer et al., 2015) (e.g., slightly, marginally), nouns (e.g., joy, euphoria), and</text>
        <edit type="redundancy" crr="" comments="redundancy - we use also at the beginning of this list, don't need it here.">also</edit>
        <text>verbs (e.g., drizzling, pouring).</text>
        <text>\n\n In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study of gradable adjectives used in clinical text. Using a method proposed by Hatzivassiloglou and Wiebe (2000), we identify the gradable adjectives in our dataset of clinical notes. We found that these adjectives have a substantial presence (30%) in our data. Further, we show that there is a specific pattern in which gradable adjectives are used: some medical concepts are more likely to be modified by these adjectives than others. Finally, we focus on a specific subset of gradable adjectives associated with measurements of numerical quantities and demonstrate the use of a simple computational model to ground their meaning.</text>
