    <introduction>
        <text>In recent years, medical records have been increasingly written in an electronic format, which leads to a growing need for natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the medical domain. Specifically, information extraction (IE) techniques, such as named entity recognition (NER), are crucial as they serve as the basis of more intellectual and/or application-oriented tasks, including information retrieval and question answering.</text>

        <text>NLP research for medical texts, specifically targeting Japanese. The participants of the task were provided with an annotated corpus consisting of 50 fictional medical history summary reports. The intended task was a type of NER and required the participants to identify patientsâ€™ personal and medical information from the reports.</text>
