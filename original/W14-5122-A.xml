        <text>are based on WordNet (Simpson et al., 2010; Pederson et al., 2004; Leacock et al., 1998; Budanitsky et al., 2006). WordNet is a lexical catalogue which is accessible online and provides a large source of English lexical items. The proposed approach incorporates the various senses of the words and</text>

        <text>\\ This paper presents a method for identifying semantic sentence similarity among sentences using WordNet. This method firstly identifies all the sense relations (hypernym, hyponym, holonym, meronymy etc.) considering the word as a noun and all the sense relations considering word as a verb from WordNet respectively. Then it uses common senses between the two respective sets as Noun and Verb for two input words for the calculation of semantic word similarity score. The similar senses and their respective counts are useful for the calculation of semantic similarity among the words. Then these</text>
