    <introduction>
        <text>In recent years, medical records have been increasingly written in an electronic format, which</text>
        <edit type="grammar" crr="is leading" comments="">leads</edit>
        <text>to a growing need for natural language processing (NLP) techniques in the medical domain. Specifically, information extraction (IE) techniques, such as named entity recognition (NER), are crucial as they serve as the basis</text>
        <edit type="grammar" crr="for" comments="">of</edit>
        <text>intellectual and/or application-oriented tasks, including information retrieval and question answering. \n\n Given the background, the NTCIR-10 MedNLP</text>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="project" comments="">task</edit>
        <text>(Morita et al., 2013) was recently held as a shared</text>

        <text>to foster</text>

        <text>participants</text>
        <edit type="conciseness" crr="" comments="">of the task</edit>
        <text>were provided with an annotated corpus consisting of 50 fictional medical history summary reports. The intended</text>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="project" comments="">task</edit>
        <text>was a type of NER and required</text>

        <text>participants to identify patientsâ€™ personal and medical information from the reports. \n\n For the MedNLP</text>

The model is based on structured perceptron (Collins, 2002) and was previously developed for the biomedical domain (Higashiyama et al., to appear).\n\n  This paper reports on the results of the structured perceptron-based model for the MedNLP</text>
        <edit type="word choice" crr="project" comments="">task</edit>
        <text>and presents their analysis. Additionally, conditional random fields (CRFs) (Lafferty et al., 2001), a popular model adopted by many participants of the task, are applied for comparison.</text>
