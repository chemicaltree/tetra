        <text>Bootstrapping Path-Based Pronoun Resolution</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>We present an approach to pronoun resolution based on syntactic paths. Through a simple bootstrapping procedure, we learn the likelihood of coreference between a pronoun and a candidate noun based on the path in the parse tree between the two entities. This path information enables us to handle previously challenging resolution instances, and also robustly addresses traditional syntactic coreference constraints. Highly coreferent paths also allow mining of precise probabilistic gender</text>

        <text>number information. We combine statistical knowledge with well- known features in a Support Vector Machine pronoun resolution classifier. Significant gains in performance are observed on several datasets.</text>

    <introduction>
        <text>Pronoun resolution is a difficult but vital part of the overall coreference resolution task. In each of the following sentences, a pronoun resolution system must determine what the pronoun his refers to: \ (1) John needs his friend. \ (2) John needs his support. In (1), John and his corefer. In (2), his refers to some other, perhaps previously evoked, entity. Traditional pronoun resolution systems are not designed to distinguish between these cases. They lack the specific world knowledge required in the second instance - the knowledge that a person does not usually explicitly need his own support.</text>
        <text>\\ We collect statistical path-coreference information from a large, automatically -parsed corpus to address this limitation. A dependency path is defined as the sequence of dependency links between two potentially coreferent entities in a parse tree. A path does not include the terminal entities; for example, “John needs his support” and “He needs their support” have the same syntactic path. Our algorithm determines that the dependency path linking the</text>

        <text>and pronoun is very likely to connect coreferent entities for the path “Noun needs pronoun's friend,” while it is rarely coreferent for the path “Noun needs pronoun's support.”</text>
        <text>\\ This likelihood can be learned by simply counting how often we see a given path in text with an initial</text>

        <text>classes. Cases such as “John needs her support” or “They need his support” are much more frequent in text than cases where the subject noun and pronoun terminals agree in gender</text>

        <text>number. When there is agreement, the terminal nouns are likely to be coreferent. When they disagree, they refer to different entities. After a sufficient number of occurrences of agreement or disagreement, there is a strong statistical indication of whether the path is coreferent (terminal nouns tend to refer to the same entity) or non-coreferent (nouns refer to different entities).</text>
        <text>\\ We show that including path- coreference information enables significant performance gains on three third-person pronoun resolution experiments. We also show that coreferent paths can provide the seed information for bootstrapping other, even more important, information, such as the gender</text>
