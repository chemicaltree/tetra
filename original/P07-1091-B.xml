        <text>A Probabilistic Approach to Syntax-based Reordering for Statistical Machine Translation</text>
    </title>
    <abstract>
        <text>Inspired by previous preprocessing approaches to SMT, this paper proposes a novel, probabilistic approach to reordering which combines the merits of syntax and phrase-based SMT. Given a source sentence and its parse tree, our method generates, by tree operations, an n-best list of reordered inputs, which are then fed</text>

        <text>However, long-distance reordering is problematic in phrase-based SMT. For example, the distance-based reordering model (Koehn et al., 2003) allows a decoder to translate in non-monotonous order, under the constraint that the distance between two phrases translated consecutively does not exceed a limit known as</text>
        <edit type="grammar" crr="the" comments=""></edit>
        <text>distortion limit. In theory, the distortion limit can be assigned a very large value so that all possible reorderings are allowed, yet in practise</text>

        <text>: In the rest of the paper, we will use the terms global reordering and local reordering in place of long-distance reordering and short-distance reordering, respectively. The distinction between</text>

        <text>by the distortion limit.</text>
        <text>\\ Syntax is certainly a potential solution to global reordering. For example, for the last two Chinese phrases in figure 1(a), simply swapping the two children of the NP node will produce the correct word order on the English side. However, there are also reorderings which do not agree with syntactic analysis. Figure 1(b) shows how our phrase-based decoder obtains a good English translation by reordering two blocks. It should be noted that the second Chinese block “结束时” and its English counterpart “at the end of” are not constituents at all.</text>
        <text>\\ In this paper, our interest is the value of syntax in reordering, and the major statement is that syntactic information is useful in handling global reordering</text>

        <text>, we developed a hybrid approach which preserves the strength of phrase-based SMT in local reordering as well as the strength of syntax in global reordering.</text>
        <text>\\ Our method is inspired by previous preprocessing approaches like (Xia and McCord, 2004), (Collins et al., 2005), and (Costa-jussa and Fonollosà, 2006), which split translation into two stages: [MATH] where a sentence of the source language (SL), S, is first reordered with respect to the word order of the target language (TL), and then the reordered SL sentence S' is translated as a TL sentence T by monotonous translation.</text>
        <text>\\ Our first contribution is a new translation model as represented by formula 2: [MATH] where an n-best list of S' , instead of only one S' , is generated. The reason</text>

        <text>change will be given in section 2. Note also that the translation process S' → T is not monotonous since the distance-based model is needed for local reordering. Our second contribution is our definition of the best translation: [MATH] where Fi are the features in the standard phrase-based model and Pr(S → S') is our new feature, </text>
