    <introduction>
        <text>Our current metrics do not address the questions “how good are current free-text de-identification systems?” and “how good do they need to be?” We need measures that quantify the risk of re-identification based on the type and amount of personal health identifier (PHI) leakage (PHI terms not redacted in the de-identification process) and measures that quantify information preservation or readability.</text>
        <text>The metrics in current use were</text>
        <edit type="word order" crr="originally developed" comments="">developed originally</edit>
        <text>for entity extraction (the correct labeling of types of phrases in free text, such as person name, date</text>
        <edit type="clarity" crr="and" comments="">,</edit>
        <text>organization). Entity extraction performance is typically measured in terms of precision, recall and balanced f-measure at both the token (word) and phrase level. The top de-identification systems (Szarvas, Farkas, and BusaFekete, 2007; Wellner, et al., 2007) performed well on these measures, as reported at the first i2b2 De-identification challenge evaluation (Uzuner, Luo, and Szolovits, 2007), achieving accuracies of over 97% token-level f-measure with a recall (sensitivity) of over 95%. Over the past several years, these results have been extended to more record types and record formats; for example, (Friedlin and McDonald, 2008) reported that their MeDS system successfully removed 99.5% of HIPAA-specified identifiers from HL7 records. These are encouraging numbers</text>

        <text>recall and precision do not tell us how good a de-identification system needs to be for a particular intended use.</text>
